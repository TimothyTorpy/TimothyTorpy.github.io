# Timothy Torpy

## Introduction

I am an Instrumentation and Controls Technician who loves and appreciates the amount of coding that makes the world function, from banking to a webpage.

## Technical Skills

I am currently learning Full Stack Development with the University of Alberta, focusing on languages like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and exploring frameworks like React for front-end development and Node.js for backend. Additionally, I have knowledge in C# for server-side applications. Notable Industrial Experience includes multiple RTUs (Remote Terminal Units) and Allen-Bradley PLCs.

## Projects

I have worked on several personal projects to hone my skills, including a web application that tracks gaming stats and a small automation script that helps manage tasks in my daily workflow. I am also in the process of building a portfolio project that combines my knowledge of instrumentation with web development, aiming to create a user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing industrial processes.

## Education

- NAIT - Instrumentation Technician
- NAIT - PLC Technician
- University of Alberta - Full Stack Development (Ongoing)

## Learning Journey

Transitioning from an Instrumentation and Controls Technician to a Full Stack Developer, I have been actively engaging in coursework offered by the University of Alberta. This journey has not only broadened my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of software development practices and principles.

## Professional Experience

As an Instrumentation and Controls Technician in a thermal coal mine, with previous experience in Oil and Gas, Industrial Air Separation facilities, I've gained extensive experience with hardware and software used in controlling and monitoring systems. This role has sharpened my problem-solving skills and my ability to work under pressure, qualities that I bring into my coding projects.

## Interests

Outside of work, I am an avid gamer, enjoy Kayaking, and more. This passion has led me to explore coding not just as a profession but as a creative outlet, where I can blend my technical skills with my love for gaming.

## Goals

My goal is to transition into a full-stack development role where I can contribute to building responsive and efficient web applications. I am particularly interested in projects that intersect with my background in instrumentation, such as IoT applications and industrial automation solutions.
